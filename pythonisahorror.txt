A collection of Python horrors.

- Because Python does not know method overloading you get the all-in-one-method signatures
	with dito explanations:
	"""
	Write a Resource List or a Resource Dump for rs on local disk

        Set of resources included is based on paths setting or else the
        mappings. Optionally links can be added. Output will be to stdout
        unless outfile is specified.

        If dump is true then a Resource Dump is written instead of a Resource
        List. If outfile is not set then self.default_resource_dump will be
        used.
    """
    Now what is this method going to do under what circumstances?
    
- Python is not strongly typed. A change of the return type of a method in a 3th party
	library is not noticed, because a method can return anything without breaking a contract.
	In stead *your code* breaks on infinite places.
